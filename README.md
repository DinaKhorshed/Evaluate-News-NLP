ProjectName: Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language Processing.

Project 4 of Udacity's Front End Web Development.

Purpose: Building a web tool (Webpack) that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze articles or any other type of text to find out things like Subjectivity, Irony, Confidence and Agreement.

Technologies implemented:
HTML -- CSS(sass) -- JavaScript -- Node -- Express -- MeaningCloud API -- WorkBox -- Jest

Installation steps:
! check if Node and NodePackageManager(NPM) are installed by using these commands:
node -v #to see if Node is installed and what version is existing.
npm -v # to find out npm, too.

- Clone the repo: git clone [https://github.com/DinaKhorshed/evaluate-news-nlp.git] or unzip the file.

- get into the project directory by using: cd [evaluate-news-nlp]

- Run `npm i`

- type `npm run build-prod` to start Webpack in Production mode --- or type `npm run build-dev` to run development mode.
Either way, you should type (in another CMD window): `npm run start` to get the server started.

- Open your browser at <http://localhost:8080/>

- put an article in the form area and press submit.
